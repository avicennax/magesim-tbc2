cast() is called 5 times; 4 cases are general, 1 is lighting capacitor.
- cast(nextSpell()) -- Kick off sim
- inside tick() -- which is run inside work()
- inside onCast() -- runs in default case after calc spell dmg.
- inside onWait()

work() processes the event queue.

(Q) How is GCD handled?

---

onCast() vs cast()

cast()
 - if gcd up: pushCast()
 - otherwise use CDs and pushSpell()

onCast()
  - most cases onCastDmg()

canCast() - checks mana for cast 
onCastDmg() - calculate spell dmg (hit, crit, etc.)

---

Actions are taken when we push() user determined events
or use consumables / CDs.

Narrative:
  - work() loops EQ.
  - See above for cast() / onCast() overview.
  - cast(spell) inserts

Happy PATH
1. We get to cast(), most cases pushSpell()
  - Either cast() now or process from queue via pushCast()
2. We process spell event in tick() with onCast()
3. Inside onCast() calculate damage via onCastDmg()
4. Still inside onCast() call cast() for next spell
  - Or if drums are up, use drums and pushCast(next, 1).

This above forms the main cast loop.

Where Actions are taken:
  - onCast
    * Check / use drums, cast(next). 
    - onCastComplete
      * Check / use gems, pots, innervate and evocate (return next spell).
  - tick
    * Primary event processor 
    - onCast
  - run
    * Run sim, push first cast.
    - cast
  - onWait
    * If spell isn't AB, cast otherwise push AB stacks.
    - cast
  - fireLightningCapacitor
    * Weird ass edge case, disregard for now.


Action Spells
  - cast()
  - pushCast() // cast() in future
  - useCooldowns()
  - useTrinkets()
  - evocate()
  - innervate()
  - use_X()
  - pushBuffGain() // Not all

Select Spell
  - nextSpell()

Perhaps using a dummy "action" event is the proper / easiest way
to expose action opportunities.

  pushCast() spell is where we decide what
  damage spell to push.
